# GenTorOnion

Edit the scripts to point to your tor binary path.

Currently they are set to:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/TorBrowser/Tor"
TOR=$HOME/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/TorBrowser/Tor/tor

Comment out LD_LIBRARY_PATH if you will be using system tor.

These scripts require tor and base64 installed.
